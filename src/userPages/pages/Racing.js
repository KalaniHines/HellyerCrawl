// For now, the race tab should just be the link to Square: https://hellyervelodrome.square.site/training-sessions
//Maybe have links to results on the page and we can import the race flyer carousel?
//Both should have a link to waivers. Race might have upgrade info too. But, that can be in info only?
//Should also implament ontheday.net for current results.
